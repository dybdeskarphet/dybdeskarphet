I'm **Arda**. I like working with backend systems, writing pretty much anything in Rust or TypeScript, and occasionally experimenting with frontend.

Most of my projects fall into two camps: things that make my daily dev life or system smoother, and things that just sound cool (or end up a little overengineered). Since I’m still a uni student, all of this happens in my free time - which probably explains the chaos :)


Since I joined GitHub **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago, I’ve:

* pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits
* opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues
* sent **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests
* earned **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** projects
* contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** repos
