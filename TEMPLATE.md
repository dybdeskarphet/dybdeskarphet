### Hey!

[![LeetCode user dybdeskarphet](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?style=flat-square&labelColor=151311&color=d8c3ab&label=solved&query=solved&url=https%3A%2F%2Fleetcode-badge.vercel.app%2Fapi%2Fusers%2Fdybdeskarphet&logo=leetcode&logoColor=yellow)](https://leetcode.com/dybdeskarphet/)

I'm **Arda**. I like working with backend systems, writing pretty much anything in Python or TypeScript, and occasionally experimenting with frontend.

Most of my projects fall into two camps: things that make my daily dev life or system smoother, and things that just sound cool (or end up a little overengineered). Since I’m still a uni student, all of this happens in my free time - which probably explains the chaos :)

Since I joined GitHub **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago, I’ve pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, sent **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, earned **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** projects, contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** repos.
