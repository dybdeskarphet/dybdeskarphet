### Hey!

I'm **Arda**. I like working with backend systems, writing pretty much anything in Rust or TypeScript, and occasionally experimenting with frontend.

Most of my projects fall into two camps: things that make my daily dev life or system smoother, and things that just sound cool (or end up a little overengineered). Since I’m still a uni student, all of this happens in my free time - which probably explains the chaos :)

Since I joined GitHub **7** years ago, I’ve pushed **1690** commits, opened **23** issues, sent **35** pull requests, earned **250** stars across **33** projects, contributed to **9** repos.
